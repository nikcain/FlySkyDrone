# FlySkyDrone

Attempt to build my own drone. A lot of the code 'inspired' by https://diyprojectslab.com/make-esp8266-drone-wallclimb-drone/ albeit rearranged/rewritten so I can learn from it and understand it.

The drone will be an ESP-WROOM-32 dev board with an MPU6050 gyro chip. I've got four 8520 15000kV brushed motors, with a vague guess at suitable propellers. For ESCs I'll be using mosfets (IRLZ34N) with PWM managed by the ESP32 (as Anish did).

Current state is working on the code. Still to do is construct the drone and start testing...
